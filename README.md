# COMP5329 Deep Learning

This is assignment code for COMP5329(USYD). There are two assignments in this course and we finish it with Python.

1. **Assignment 1** : Data is given by teacher and we don't know where it comes from and what it represents. The Goal is developing a Multiple hidden layer neural network for multi-object classification without using third packages like Tensorflow but except for numpy.

2. **Assignment 2**ï¼šGiven a set of pictures including character uppercase and lowercase a-z, A-Z, and number 1-9 to do a multi-label classification. We use Keras for this assignment.
